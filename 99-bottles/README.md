# 99 Bottles

__Practicing Python via 99 Bottles__

Sandi Metz wrote a book called "99 Bottles", to discuss Object Oriented
Programming(OOP) ideas.  Originally, it was written in Ruby. It has
recently been updated for PHP and JS developers. I read the sample
chapters, and thought it'd be the perfect opportunity to try it in
Python. 

I thought it'd be interesting to try it differently after each time
Sandi discusses a topic in the book. So I need to buy the book. But I'll
do that at another time.
