# Python Practice

__A personal repo to learn Python__

I'm a PHP Developer that is learning how to write Python. I don't have
any experience with Python, so I'm starting with the basics. Each
top-level directory will be it's own self-contained project.


## Version

This repo doesn't use versions, since each top-level directory is an
independent exercise.
